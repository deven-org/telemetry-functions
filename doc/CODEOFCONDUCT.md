# Code of Conduct

Our team is dedicated to creating a safe and inclusive community for all users, contributors, and maintainers, regardless of their gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, ethnicity or religion. We do not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination towards any individual or group within our community.

Harassment can include, but is not limited to, offensive comments, unwelcome sexual advances, and derogatory language or actions based on an individual's personal characteristics. Discrimination can include treating individuals unfairly or differently based on their personal characteristics.

This code of conduct applies to all interactions within the project's GitLab page and Slack channels, including discussions, comments, and contributions. It also applies to any in-person or virtual events or meetings related to our community.

If anyone experiences or witnesses harassment or discrimination within our community, we encourage them to report it to the core team. We will take any reports seriously and investigate them thoroughly. We reserve the right to take appropriate action, including expelling individuals who violate this code of conduct from our community spaces.

All users, contributors, and maintainers are expected to read and follow this code of conduct. It is their responsibility to create a welcoming and respectful environment within our community.
